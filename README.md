This project is a custom sales and inventory management system developed for my girlfriend‚Äôs silver jewelry store (https://www.instagram.com/mariarusso.joias/). It was built to help organize and track products, categories, stock levels, and customer orders in a simple and efficient way.

# üöÄ Tech Stack

- Backend: Laravel 12

- Frontend: React + Inertia.js

- Infrastructure: Docker (for local development)

# ‚úÖ Features
- Product management (CRUD)

# üéØ Purpose
The goal of this system is to help a small business run more smoothly by replacing manual tracking with a digital system that is tailored to its needs. It also served as a personal learning experience to improve my skills in full-stack development using modern web technologies.
